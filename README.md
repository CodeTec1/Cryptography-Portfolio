# Cryptography-Portfolio

## Description

This repository contains various cryptography projects and lab exercises completed during the course.

## Lab Exercices

### Lab 1: Key Generation Algorithm using Prime Numbers
This lab focuses on generating cryptographic keys using prime numbers. Prime numbers are fundamental in cryptography due to their unique properties, ensuring secure encryption and decryption processes. The program randomly selects two prime numbers (p and q) from a specified range and demonstrates their generation through code implementation in Python.

### Lab 2: Eulerâ€™s Totient Function
Euler's Totient Function is pivotal in number theory and cryptography, calculating the count of integers less than a given number that are coprime with it. This lab builds upon Lab 1 by extending the program to compute Euler's Totient Function values for the generated prime numbers (p and q). The implementation includes understanding relatively prime numbers and their significance in cryptographic operations.

### Lab 3: Implementation of RSA Encryption and Decryption
RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) encryption is a widely-used public-key cryptography algorithm. This lab demonstrates the implementation of RSA, including the generation of multiple pairs of public and private keys (PU(e, n) and PR(d, n)), encryption and decryption of a user-input message using the generated keys, and an in-depth lab report detailing the code, sample outputs, and explanations.
