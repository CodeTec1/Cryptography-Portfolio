# Cryptography-Portfolio

## Description

This repository contains various cryptography class acitivies,group projects and lab exercises completed during the course.

## Lab Exercices

### Lab 1: Key Generation Algorithm using Prime Numbers
This lab focuses on generating cryptographic keys using prime numbers. Prime numbers are fundamental in cryptography due to their unique properties, ensuring secure encryption and decryption processes. The program randomly selects two prime numbers (p and q) from a specified range and demonstrates their generation through code implementation in Python.

### Lab 2: Eulerâ€™s Totient Function
Euler's Totient Function is pivotal in number theory and cryptography, calculating the count of integers less than a given number that are coprime with it. This lab builds upon Lab 1 by extending the program to compute Euler's Totient Function values for the generated prime numbers (p and q). The implementation includes understanding relatively prime numbers and their significance in cryptographic operations.

### Lab 3: Implementation of RSA Encryption and Decryption
RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) encryption is a widely-used public-key cryptography algorithm. This lab demonstrates the implementation of RSA, including the generation of multiple pairs of public and private keys (PU(e, n) and PR(d, n)), encryption and decryption of a user-input message using the generated keys, and an in-depth lab report detailing the code, sample outputs, and explanations.

## Group Projects

### Project 1: RSA Algorithm Implementation with Key Exchange over TCP
This project demonstrates the implementation of the RSA cryptographic algorithm with 1024-bit key size. It includes the generation of public and private keys, as well as the encryption and decryption processes between two parties, Alice and Bob, using a TCP socket-based communication channel.

### Project 2: Credit Card Vault Project
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a secure credit card storage system that includes data encryption, user authentication, and access control mechanisms. It also involves hosting the application with an SSL certificate to ensure secure communication.
